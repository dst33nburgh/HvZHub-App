Features:
- **Chat:** Chat with fellow humans(or zombies if that's your thing). Now with push notifications!
- **Mission Updates:** Stay up to date with the latest mission announcements
- **Game News:** See when people get tagged.
- **Report a tag:** Eat some tasty brains.
- **View your code:** But don't forget to write it down on an index card too.
- **Heatmap:** See where zombies have fed in the past. Stay away from the hotspots so you don't get tagged. The heatmap will slowly get more accurate as more tags are made.
